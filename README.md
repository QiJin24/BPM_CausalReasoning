**"Data-Driven Decision Support for Business
Processes: Causal Reasoning on Interventions"**

by: *Ali J. Alaee, Avigdor Gal, Matthias Weidlich, and Arik Senderovich*

*Abstract:
Various types of decisions influence the execution of a business process in terms of control-flow, resource assignments, etc. Data recorded during process execution can be used to identify which decisions are informed by data, predict their outcome, and use interventions to influence them. Yet, existing business process models offer limited decision, focusing on modelling of causal effects while mostly neglecting decision identification and reasoning about interventions. In this paper, we fill this gap, introducing a business process causal decision model that generalizes existing models for decision support by incorporating latent variables and by capturing the stochastic nature of decisions. Using this model, we show how to characterize whether a decision can be analyzed using available data, how to conduct interventional outcome prediction, and how to improve decision-making by acquiring missing data to increase the utility of possible interventions. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through experiments with a real-world dataset.*
